 <h1> CardWise: Smart Credit Card Approval Predictor </h1>
CardWise is a website that helps you find out if you might get approved for a credit card.

After you submit a form with some personal and financial information, the website employs a "smart system"—a sophisticated calculator that has learned from numerous previous examples—to determine your chances of being accepted or rejected right away and provide a brief explanation of the decision.
